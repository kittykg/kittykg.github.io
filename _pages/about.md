Hello, I'm Kexin, you can also call me Kitty üê±.

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cisco
ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/), working in Endpoint Agent Team.
I'm also a part-time PhD student at [Imperial College
London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), supervised by Prof. [Alessandra
Russo](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/).


My research area is in neuro-symbolic learning, and I'm interested in classical
Logic and pure symbolic learning. I'm part of the [SPIKE research
group](https://spike.doc.ic.ac.uk/).

I previously studied my MEng in Computing (Artificial Intelligence) at Imperial.
