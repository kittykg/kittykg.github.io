## Gaming

I'm a PC/VR/console gamer, and a member of [Fat Pigeon Gaming](https://twitter.com/FatPigeonGaming), a esports group created by SPIKE members. Currently we are
playing Heroes of the Storm and we stream regularly on Tuesday 20:00 UK time at
our [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/fat_pigeon_gaming).

I'm particularly good at rhythm games such as Synth Riders and Beat Saber, but
quite noob at MoBA although I really like DotA :/

I'm also a casual Cardfight Vanguard player -- Alchemagic Zorga enjoyer :P Participated in BSF 2022 and 2023 for fun.



## Art

I enjoy digital drawing and I've designed all the pigeon avatars for Fat Pigeon
Gaming. Here's my avatar below :P
