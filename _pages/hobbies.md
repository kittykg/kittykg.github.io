## Advent of Code

AoC enjoyer, participated since 2020. Enjoying solving AoC with Prolog. Post
memes from times to times about Prolog solutions on
[r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/). When I'm busy I will
settle with Python.

## Gaming

I'm a PC/VR/console gamer, and a member of [Fat Pigeon
Gaming](https://twitter.com/FatPigeonGaming), a esports group created by SPIKE
members. Currently we are playing Heroes of the Storm and we stream regularly on
Thursday 20:00 UK time at our [Twitch
channel](https://www.twitch.tv/fat_pigeon_gaming).

I'm particularly good at rhythm games such as Synth Riders and maimai, but quite
noob at Dota 2 :/

I'm also a casual Cardfight Vanguard player -- Alchemagic Zorga enjoyer :P
Participated in BSF 2022 and 2023 for fun.

## Art

I enjoy digital drawing and I've designed all the pigeon avatars for Fat Pigeon
Gaming. Here's my avatar below :P
