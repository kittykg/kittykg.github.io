excerpt: A teaching tool for teaching primary school students programming by controlling a drone.
---

A teaching tool targeting primary school students to teach them programming. By
letting students write code to control a drone and make it complete several
tasks which cover a wide range of contexts, students could learn basic
programming concepts and gain experience of interpreting 'wordy' questions. The
outreach team of Department of Computing of Imperial College has used it in a
primary school and has great feedback from the students.
