A gamified pet drone that interacts and plays with you. By converting your
speech to text and extracting the sentiments of the sentences through natural
language processing, the drone will either act as your command if his
satisfaction is high, or not do anything if he's upset. Won the *Best
Entertainment Hack prize* in IC Hack 20.
